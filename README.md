# Scripts and supplementary materials
The simple scripts were designed to process output files of hmmscan and calculate the gain and lose of domains/combinations in the user customized phylogenetic tree. Here i used a simple dataset to run my scripts. You can modify the scripts to reach your goals.

The "Synteny evidence supporting non-core domains.zip" (exceeding GitHub's 25MB limit) was split into 20MB parts using split -b 20M. To reconstruct: 1) Download all parts (_aa, _ab etc.), 2) Run cat *part_* > restored.zip in their directory.

The "Phylogenetic evidence supporting horizontal transfer domains.zip" contains phylogenetic trees for all putative horizontal transfer events identified in this study.
